                    <h3>Become a Computer scientist</h3>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m Anisur Rahman From Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently studying at the University of the People, USA (Remote),this is my 1st year of study. My major is computer science. In the meantime, I have completed a web development course (MERN stack) from Programming Hero.<br /> I am passionate about computer science because I love programming. I have a deep interest in software engineering, In-Sha-Allah, which will be my MS program in higher education.
                        My course focus is primarily on front-end, secondarily on back-end web applications. I have completed 12 projects in my courses, 2 full-stack projects, and the rest of them are front-end and front-end functionalities.
